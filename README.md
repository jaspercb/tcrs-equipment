# tcrs-equipment

tcrs-equipment is a script that will tell you what items you have available in Two Crazy Random Summer in the Kingdom of Loathing.

It visits inventory.php and parses modifiers directly from the HTML. It is not good code.

## Installation

Run this command in the graphical CLI:
<pre>
svn checkout https://github.com/jaspercb/tcrs-equipment/trunk/RELEASE/
</pre>
May require [a recent build of KoLMafia](http://builds.kolmafia.us/job/Kolmafia/lastSuccessfulBuild/).
